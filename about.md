### Me?

Greetings, I am Hilario, also know as "Hila".

I am Canadian and originally from in Havana, Cuba. Though, I have spent severals years in East Europe, France, Italy, England and in the former USSR where I completed my Bachelor Engineer Degree and later also my Master of Information Technology degree from the Caspian International Maritime Academy. I have also a PhD Degree from the University of Havana, Cuba in Geospatial Analytics and Data visualization.

I am a dedicated professional in: 

 1. Data Science 
 2. GeoSpatial Data Infrastructure

I currently live in Ontario, Canada, working as a Data Scientist at LASGEO. LASGEO is a leading geomatics firm based in Niagara region, Ontario, specialized in indoor positioning and indoor navigation (IPIN) which used a network of devices and in most of the cases without any external hardware or beacon to locate people or objects where GPS and other satellite technologies lack precision or fail entirely, such as inside multistory buildings, airports, alleys, parking garages, and underground locations. LASGEO use this data and information to make a detailed observation and report them in the form of measurements, maps, progress reports, inspection reports, 3d models. We provide geospatial fill-in for in-door outdoor Lidar photogrammetry, satellite and aerial data or small area processing up to 20sq km. I use statistics and machine learning to solve our customer's analytics problems, and incorporating predictive models in Geospatial data infrastructure. Being a versatile professional of several trades from Oceanographer to Senior Data Science, in IT I also build front-end applications, dashboards and visualisations to help our customers interact with our data products. I am acting more recently as a Data Translator and Data Interpreter to support the Insgiht storytelling from dissimile raw data. 

In the past I've worked as a Database Administrator and functioning as a Data Analayst in a service oriented startup, <em>EVANS COMPUTER APPLICATIONS</em> based in Nova Scotia, <em>CANBEAN ASSOCIATES</em> and <em>CADDLE</em> based in Ontario, Canada.

Undoubtedly, I have my reasonable amount of startup experience, and the already international accepted philosophy of <em>"GO-GET-IT-DONE FOR YESTERDAY"</em> that comes with it.

I'm also <em>really</em> into sailing, photography, and 3D modelling, creative writing and teaching. I love sports between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons.

7. <em>I.D.E:</em>  • Jupyter Notebook •  VisualStudio Code •  Spyder •  GeoPandas

8. <em>Data cloud deployment:</em>  • AWS •  Azure 

<em>and more!</em>


### Certificates and Projects on the go:

* Statistics Specialization: 
    1. Inferential Statistics - by Duke University - Coursera
    2. Introduction to Probability and Data - by Duke University - Coursera
    3. SPSS training.
    4. MatLab for Engineers and Scientist.
    
* Big Data Foundations
    1. Hadoop and Spark - by IBM - Big Data University

* R programming 
    1. Data Science with R - Udemy
    2. R for Engineers

* Python
