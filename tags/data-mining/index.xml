News Classifier Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Itertools, Sklearn
Summary In this research project we took a political dataset from the 2016 US Presidential elections and created a machine learning model using Python to classify the news as REAL or FAKE. We implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model. Finally, we run an uncertainty evaluation of the model to obtain the level of accuracy.</description>

      <description>In this study the main goal is to evaluate the concentrations of the modern piracy incidents around the world. Modern-day pirates around the world share the legal designation of their historic brethren as “enemies of all mankind” because they disrupt and hinder the safe navigation of maritime vessels containing goods and people.
As we already know Piracy still exists in the 21st Century. Piracy is a global crime which impedes the free movement of ships containing people and goods, with its attendant economic ramifications.</description>

I put together all the information related to the GDP and see it relationship per capita. It is already known that Per capita GDP is a metric that breaks down a country&amp;rsquo;s GDP per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year.</description>
