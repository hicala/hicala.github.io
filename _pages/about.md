Greetings, I am Hila (Hilario) Calderon.

I am a dedicated professional in: 

 1. Data Science 
 2. GeoSpatial Data Infrastructure
 
I am Canadian and originally from in Havana, Cuba. Though, I have spent severals years in France, Italy, England and East Europewhere I completed my Bachelor Engineer Degree and  Master of Science degree. I have also a PhD Degree from the University of Havana, Cuba in Geospatial Analytics and Data visualization.

I currently live in Ontario, Canada, working as a Data Scientist at LASGEO,  a leading geomatics firm based in Niagara region, Ontario, specialized in indoor positioning and indoor navigation (IPIN). At LASGEO I am in charge of using Data and information to make a detailed insights report for further analysis.

I use statistics and machine learning to solve our customer's analytics problems, and incorporating predictive models as a Data Scientist and extrapolating this fundamentals to the Geospatial data infrastructure. 

Being a versatile professional of several trades from Oceanographer to Senior Data Science, in IT I also build front-end applications, dashboards and visualisations to help our customers interact with our data products. I am acting more recently as a Data Translator and Data Interpreter to support the Insgiht storytelling from dissimile raw data. 

In the past I've worked as a Data Analyst, Database Administrator and Business Intelligence Analyst and Geospatial Data Manager functioning working for Government, NGO, Academia, Defense, Industry,  and in several service oriented startups, 

Undoubtedly, I have my reasonable amount of startup experience, and the already international accepted philosophy of <em>"GO-GET-IT-DONE FOR YESTERDAY"</em> that comes with it.

I'm also <em>really</em> into sailing, photography, and 3D modelling, creative writing and teaching. I love sports between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons.
